# 1.0.5
- Mod works with Geometry Pride (`flingus.geometry_pride`) by flingus (thanks hiimjustin000).
- Small fixes like `!oldtitle->isVisible() || !oldtitle` becoming `!oldtitle || !oldtitle->isVisible()`.

# 1.0.4 
- Make a button on the `bottom-menu` if there is no `main-title` in the `MenuLayer`.
- Because of the change above, the mod incompatibilities have been removed.

# 1.0.3
- Center the text better
- Not include `geode.node-ids` (Node IDs) because geometry dash already adds ids to the LoadingLayer and MenuLayer
- Use `_spr` in ids
- Update `about.md` and `README.md`
- Remove some unimportant code
- Added incompatibilities
- Change mod description to be more accurate
