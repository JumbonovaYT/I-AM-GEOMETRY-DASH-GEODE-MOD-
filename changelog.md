# 1.0.6
- Add "SWAMP IZZO", requested by [KankagameTR](user:24881859), as well as "FWAEH" and "SEEYUH" (my idea).
- Remove some useless code like... adding 0... :sob:
- Center the `MenuLayer` text better again (this is the last time i swear).
- Fix some of me being dumb on this in v1.0.3 (geode adds ids, not geometry dash).
- iOS support.

# 1.0.5
- Mod works with Geometry Pride (`flingus.geometry_pride`) by flingus (thanks hiimjustin000).
- Small fixes like `!oldtitle->isVisible() || !oldtitle` becoming `!oldtitle || !oldtitle->isVisible()`.

# 1.0.4 
- Make a button on the `bottom-menu` if there is no `main-title` in the `MenuLayer`.
- Because of the change above, the mod incompatibilities have been removed.

# 1.0.3
- Center the text better
- Not include `geode.node-ids` (Node IDs) because geode already adds ids to the LoadingLayer and MenuLayer
- Use `_spr` in ids
- Update `about.md` and `README.md`
- Remove some unimportant code
- Added incompatibilities
- Change mod description to be more accurate

# 1.0.2
- Fix the includes in `main.cpp`

# 1.0.1
- Add resources because i forgot to in v1 :sob:

# 1.0.0
- Release
