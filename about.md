# I AM GEOMETRY DASH

Change the Geometry Dash logo to be a clickable button (or make a button in the bottom-menu if there is no logo found), in the style of the I AM MUSIC album cover, that makes a popup saying one of the following:
- "12 0CLOCK PST"
- "FRIDAY"
- "love all my supporters - it's time"
- "ONLY TOOK 5 YEARS"
- "ANY MINUTE NOW"
- "I AM GEOMETRY DASH"
- "00XO - IT'S TIME"
- "TONIGHT."
- "TURN MY VOLUME UP"
- "HAVE FAITH."
- "I AM GEOMETRY DASH - THE GAME - FRIDAY"
- "PREPARE"
- "BE READY."
- "I AM GEOMETRY DASH OUT NOW"
- "MARCH"
- "DASH - DASH - DASH - DASH - DASH"
- "SWAMP IZZO"
- "FWAEH"
- "SEEYUH".
